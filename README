# Next Word Prediction

This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to predict the most likely next word(s) given a sequence of input text.

## Features

- Preprocessing and tokenization of input text
- Training on custom or standard text datasets
- Predicts the next word based on context
- Supports evaluation and testing of model accuracy

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NLTK or spaCy
- NumPy, pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SaisatwikBiku/next_word_prediction
    cd next_word_prediction
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Train the model:
    ```
    python train.py
    ```
3. Predict the next word:
    ```
    python predict.py --input "Your input text here"
    ```
